This is my first project for my first year as a computer Science Student.

Basically this was supposed to be a USTP Uniform detector through the use of opencv and much datas but unfortunately, I lacked the knowledge
and skills required to perform such task. Other than that, instead of doing the full uniform detector, I just started with something more doable
for a person that is still a baby in programming.

Overview:
	This is a program made to detect the white or black shirts or any colored shirt,
depending on the specified class within the code that each user can modify. I have used a haar cascade for either a fullbody or upperbody. Since I stated that it will detect shirts with the shades of black or white I have used the haarcascade_upperbody. Within the code, if you want to modify anything please do. 

Note:
	Configure your IDE to have CPP and opencv for it to run flawlessly. If not then it won't run.
